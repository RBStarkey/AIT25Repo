			This is a Blazor static web app hosted in Microsoft Azure.  It is a showcase for the skills and products that we can bring to a modern web-database...
		</h5>
		<h1>Web Database Design</h1>
		<h5>
			Since 1994 ACCESSible IT Limited has created bespoke, reliable, legal, secure, robust databases and applications
			for personnel management, absence monitoring, document management, caring services, bulk e-mailing,
			SMS Messaging, billing, work-in-progress, costing, training timetables and classroom allocation.
			These systems support clients in central and local government, the engineering and automotive industries as
			well as commerce and the charitable sector.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			We use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Teams</a>
			to provide remote guidance, support and training.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			We offer experienced, sound, commercially unbiased, free of charge advice about trends, issues, bugs and best practice for a proposed database - we can guide you through a project that will not fail.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2>Microsoft Azure</h2>
		<h5>
			We design database-web apps hosted in Microsoft's Azure cloud using SQL Server or CosmosDB.
			These sites are secured with Azure Active Directory (now called Microsoft Entra).
			Sophisticated reporting can be achieved with a free subscription to Power BI. Bulk emailing can be achieved using
			<a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/SendGrid.SendGrid">Sendgrid</a> (25,000 emails a month for free!)
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Select a demonstator page from the sidebar to see what can be achieved using Microsoft
			<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2>Microsoft Access</h2>
		<h5>
			<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/access?rtc=1">MS Access</a>
			is a rapid application development tool for creating relational databases quickly.  First published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access">1992</a>
			, it is a solid and reliable platform for data management.  It has a first rate reporting package as well as the ability to share data with the Office Suite.
			We have experience in maintaining legacy systems and mentoring the more adventurous user who wants to develop an existing system.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2>Excel, Outlook and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</h2>
		<h5>
			VBA is the common feature that allows all the MS Office applications (Excel, Word, Outlook etc) to
			manipulate and share data; it is a mature and stable programming language.
			We have experience in creating automated Word templates and extending Excel and Outlook.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2>Azure CosmosDB</h2>
		<h5>
			<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction">CosmosDB</a> is our preferred
			back-end data store for web dabases. It is secure, fast and robust; it will hold very large amounts of data.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<h2>SQL Server Express</h2>
		<h5>
			<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-2019">SQL Server Express</a> is our preferred back-end data store for on-premises systems.
			The express version is free; used with MS Access as a front-end it provides a reliable and inexpensive database system.
		</h5>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h3>An Existing Access Database?</h3>
		<h5>
			If you have a database where data disappears, or it keeps telling you someone else
			has changed the data or it responds like a snail and crashes once a week then why
			not zip up the database and email it to us?
			There is no charge for this. (If the database contains sensitive data, don't forget to password protect the zip file).
		</h5>
		<h5>
			We will look at it and give you an opinion	about the state of the code and the data model as well as some good advice to stop it crashing.
		</h5>
		<h5>
			Alternatively, we can send you a signed non-disclosure agreement and then remotely access your PC to look at the database (under your supervision).
			You can demonstrate the problem and we can proffer solutions. We assume that you own the copyright.
		</h5>
		<h4>Mentoring</h4>
		<h5>
			Sometimes you have enough technical competence to solve the day-to-day challenges but you
			need someone to sit with you and analyse a complex data management problem.
			We offer a broad range of experience to demonstrate options or to set you on your
			way towards a fresh solution. We call this mentoring or one-to-one training.
