	<h5>
		We use <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software">Teams</a>
		to provide remote guidance, support and training.
	</h5>
	<h5>

	<h2>Microsoft Azure</h2>
	<h5>
		We design database-web apps hosted in Microsoft's Azure cloud using SQL Server or CosmosDB.
		These sites are secured with Azure Active Directory (now called Microsoft Entra).
		Sophisticated reporting can be achieved with a free subscription to Power BI. Bulk emailing can be achieved using
		<a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/SendGrid.SendGrid">Sendgrid</a> (25,000 emails a month for free!)

<div class="row">
	<h2>Microsoft Access</h2>
	<h5>
		<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/access?rtc=1">MS Access</a>
		is a rapid application development tool for creating relational databases quickly.  First published in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Access">1992</a>
		, it is a solid and reliable platform for data management.  It has a first rate reporting package as well as the ability to share data with the Office Suite.
		We have experience in maintaining legacy systems and mentoring the more adventurous user who wants to develop an existing system.
	</h5>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<h2>Excel, Outlook and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</h2>
	<h5>
		VBA is the common feature that allows all the MS Office applications (Excel, Word, Outlook etc) to
		manipulate and share data; it is a mature and stable programming language.
		We have experience in creating automated Word templates and extending Excel and Outlook.
	</h5>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<h2>Azure CosmosDB</h2>
	<h5>
		<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction">CosmosDB</a> is our preferred
		back-end data store for web dabases. It is secure, fast and robust; it will hold very large amounts of data.
	</h5>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<h2>SQL Server Express</h2>
	<h5>
		<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/sql-server/sql-server-2019">SQL Server Express</a> is our preferred back-end data store for on-premises systems.
		The express version is free; used with MS Access as a front-end it provides a reliable and inexpensive database system.
