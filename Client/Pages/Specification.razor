		<h3>Initial Specification</h3>
	</div>
	<h4>
		Having met and discussed requirements and a price, you may like us to proceed to drawing up a specification document; this is usually four to six-page long.
		Sometimes it helps if you can see what we envisage to be the requirement, so we build a mock-up front-end comprising just forms; they does nothing other than look like the final design.
		We find that at this point you recognise the nuances of your requirement which have escaped our understanding. Then, there is then a flurry of emails as the final design takes shape.
		The document and the mock-ups shuttle back and forth as ypur understanding of the system is firmed up.
		At the end of the process, you will understand what we intend to build for you in considerable detail.
